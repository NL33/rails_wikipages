$ gem install rails

$ rails new wikipages -d postgresql â€“T

[note: can also replace the postgres reference by creating a file called .railsrc in your home directory and type -d postgresql -T.]

2 temporary configuration changes we need to make before starting.
	In config/application.rb, we need to add config.action_controller.permit_all_parameters = true just before the last two end keywords. 
	In app/controllers/application_controller.rb, we need to comment out the line that says protect_from_forgery with: :exception. We'll discuss these more later.
